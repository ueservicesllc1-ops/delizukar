    "title": "Our History",
    "content": "For more than twelve years, baking has become an essential part of my life. What began as a simple curiosity, accompanied by my husband, soon transformed into a deep passion: creating with my hands small works full of flavor, emotion, and love.\n\nI've always believed that every sweet treat has the power to tell a story, bring a smile to a smile, or revive a special memory. That's why, for me, it's not just about baking. It's about bringing each of my creations to life, taking care of every detail, and putting my heart into every recipe.\n\nOur kitchen isn't just a workplace; it's our dream workshop. It's where we combine tradition, creativity, and a lot of dedication to ensure that each cookie, cake, or dessert conveys more than just good flavor: it conveys love, joy, and the sincere desire to make others happy.\n\nAlong this journey, I've learned, failed, improved, and, above all, grown. And although there are still many dreams left to fulfill, every step has been worth it, because I'm doing what I love.\n\nToday, I continue creating, learning, and dreaming hand in hand with my husband. Because as long as there are people who believe in HOMEMADE WITH LOVE, baking will continue to be my way of speaking to the world.\n\nThank you for being here and for letting us be part of your sweetest moments."

The Lotus filling has a delicious flavor, not too sweet, and with that touch of caramel and spices that I love. You can tell they are made with a lot of love at home. I will definitely buy them again; they are perfect for my afternoon coffee."
